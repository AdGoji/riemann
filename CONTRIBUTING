# To get started
lein deps
lein javac
lein protobuf compile
lein compile

# Make your changes on a new branch

# Check that they work with
lein test

# My sincere apologies--the test suite includes email and graphite integration,
# which may not be configured on your machine. There are also some truly awful
# time-sensitive side-effects tests (notably percentiles) which fail some of
# the time. I haven't had the time to clean them up yet.

# When you're ready, push your changes and send me a pull req.

# You can run the server with
lein run reimann.config

# Tarball
# Check/update the version number in pkg/bin/reimann; should match the current
# project.clj version.
lein ubertar

# Debian package
# Check/update the version number in project.clj's deb section. Should match
# the current project version.
