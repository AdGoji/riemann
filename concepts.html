      <h1>Reimann is an <span class="focus">event stream</span> processor.</h1> 

      <p>Every time something important happens in your system, submit an event
      to Reimann. Just handled an HTTP request? Send an event with the time it
      took. Caught an exception? Send an event with the stacktrace. Small
      daemons can watch your servers and send events about disk capacity, CPU
      use, and memory consumption. Every five seconds. It's like top for
      hundreds of machines at once.</p>
      
      <p class="callout">Reimann filters, combines, and acts on thousands of events per second to give you useful information.</p>

          <h2>Events</h2>

          <p>Events are just structs. They're sent over Protocol Buffers, and
          in Reimann are treated as immutable maps. Each event has these
          (optional) fields:</p>

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>host</th>
              <td>A hostname, e.g. "api1", "foo.com"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>service</th>
              <td>e.g. "API port 8000 reqs/sec"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>state</th>
              <td>Any string less than 255 bytes, e.g. "ok", "warning", "critical"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>time</th>
              <td>The time that the service entered this state, in unix time</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>description</th>
              <td>Freeform text</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>tags</th>
              <td>Freeform list of strings, e.g. ["rate", "fooproduct", "transient"]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>metric</th>
              <td>A number associated with this event, e.g. the number of reqs/sec.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>ttl</th>
              <td>A floating-point time, in seconds, that this event is considered valid for. Expired states may be removed from the index.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>

          <h2>Servers</h2>
          <p>The Reimann process listens on port 5555 for TCP connections and
          UDP datagrams. It accepts a stream of protocol buffer <i>messages</i>
          containing <i>events</i> (or queries, control messages, etc). Those
          events are then applied to a tree of <i>streams</i>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Streams</h2>
          <p>A stream is a function that accepts a single event. Many streams
          accept children, to which they can forward events. Together, the
          streams form a directed graph along which events flow.</p>

          <p>A stream can filter the events it receives, passing on those that
          match some predicate. They can pass on a changed event to their
          children, or fork into several distinct substreams. They can compute
          percentiles, rates, or moving averages. Streams can send email about
          the events they receive, forward events to other Reimann servers, or
          send them to Graphite. Any clojure function accepting an event map
          can be a stream.</p>

          <p>See the <a href="api/reimann.streams.html">Streams API</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>The Index</h2>
          <p>A special type of stream updates the index: a table of the current
          state of all services tracked by Reimann. Indexed states can be queried by a Reimann client to see what the system looks like now. The <a href="dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> is just an HTML view of the index.</p>
          
          <p>Events entered into the index have a :ttl field; states that sit
          in the index for too long are removed from the index and reinserted
          into the event streams with state "expired". This means that services
          which fail to check in regularly enough can trigger alerts.</p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Queries</h2>
          <p>Clients can query the index for particular events.</p>

          <code><pre># Simple equality
state = "ok"

# Wildcards
(service =~ "disk%") or 
(state != "critical" and host =~ "%.trioptimum.com")

# Standard operator precedence applies
metric_f &gt; 2.0 and not host = nil

# Anything with a tag "product"
tagged "product"

# All states
true

# No states
false</pre></code>

          <p>Query messages return a list of matching events. The full grammar is <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/reimann/blob/master/src/reimann/Query.g">here</a>.</p>
