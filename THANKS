#flatland, #clojure and #leiningen, including jodaro, ninjudd, raynes, and
amalloy, helped with protobufs parsing, leiningen, and general clojure
questions.

Showyou, my employer, gave me the problems I needed Reimann for, and the time
to solve them.

John Mullerleile (jrecursive) was deeply involved in talking through the
concept and structure of Reimann, as well as offering advice around the JVM.

C Scott Andreas (cscotta) gave many helpful suggestions around the JVM, Maven,
high_scale_lib. Our conversations filled my head with many excellent algorithms
and ideas.

arohner on #clojure offered a logging snippet.

Ryan Grove and Sean Cribbs gave feedback on documentation and design.

Sam Newman (snewman) brought Reimann up to speed with Clojure 1.3.
