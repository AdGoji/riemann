      <p>I built Riemann to solve my problems, but I want it to work for you,
      too. If you use Riemann, <a href="mailto:aphyr@aphyr.com">send me an
        email</a> about how it's working for you, or what needs to change</a>. Frustrated with the API? Find a bug? <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/riemann/issues">Open an issue</a>.</p>
    
    <p class="callout">The best way to say "thank you" is to contribute code. <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/riemann">It's all on Github</a>.</p>

          <h2>Building</h2>
          <code><pre>git clone git://github.com/aphyr/riemann.git</pre></code>

          <p>Riemann uses <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a>, the Clojure build tool. First, fetch dependencies:</p>

          <code><pre>lein deps</pre></code>

          <p>Build the java query parser:</p>
          <code><pre>lein javac</pre></code>

          <p>Build the protocol buffer classes:</p>
          <code><pre>lein protobuf compile</pre></code>

          <p>And run the test suite:</p>
          <code><pre>lein test</pre></code>

          <p>Or, for a specific namespace:</p>
          <code><pre>lein test riemann.test.streams</pre></code>

          <p>I'm really sorry about this, but there are some poorly-written
          tests for time-dependent streams like rates and percentiles. These
          can be finicky; I'm working on rewriting them as soon as possible.
          Some tests also rely on a local graphite install or sendmail; you can
          ignore them if you aren't changing those components.</p>

          <p>You can run the server with</p>

          <code><pre>lein run riemann.config</pre></code>

          <p>and when you're ready to package, just <code>lein package</code>
          to build both regular and standalone jars, a debian package, tarball,
          and pom.xml.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Pull Requests</h2>
          
          <p>When you've made your changes (for anything non-trivial, on a
          topic branch, please), send me a pull request on Github. Please run
          the test suite before submitting, and keep your commits focused.</p>
        </div>

          <h2><a name="protocol" style="color: inherit">Protocol</a></h2>
          
          <p>A connection to Riemann is a stream of messages. Each message is a
          4 byte network-endian integer *length*, followed by a Protocol Buffer
          Message of *length* bytes. See <a
            href="https://github.com/aphyr/riemann/blob/master/proto/riemann/proto.proto">proto/riemann/proto.proto</a>
          for the protobuf particulars.</p>

          <p>Over UDP, the length header is omitted; just send the protobuf
          directly. UDP datagrams have a default maximum size of 16384 bytes by
          Riemann's default; larger messages should go over TCP. This limit is
          configurable in both the client and server.</p>

          <p>The server will accept a repeated list of Events, and respond with
          a confirmation message with either an acknowledgement or an error.
          Check the `ok` boolean in the message; if false, message.error will
          be a descriptive string.</p>

          <p>Because protocol buffers is strongly typed, the metric field is
          represented on the wire as metric_f. At some point I'll add an int64
          as well.</p>

          <p>Events are uniquely identified by host and service. Both allow
          null.  Event.time is the time in unix epoch seconds and is optional.
          The server will generate a time for each event when received if you
          do not provide one. I don't need time resolution finer than 1 second
          presently, but if you do, my plan is to add a nanosecond field as
          well.</p>

          <p>You can also query events from the index using a basic query
          language. Just submit a Message with your query in
          message.query.string. Search queries will return a message with
          repeated Events matching that expression. A
null expression will return no states.</p>

          <h2>Thanks</h2>
          <p>#flatland, #clojure and #leiningen, including jodaro, ninjudd,
          raynes, and amalloy, helped with protobufs parsing, leiningen, and
          general Clojure questions.</p>

          <p><a href="http://showyou.com">Showyou</a>, my employer, gave me the
          infrastructure I needed Riemann for, and the chance to share it with
          the world.</p>

          <p>John Mullerleile (jrecursive) was deeply involved in talking
          through the concept and structure of Riemann, as well as advice
          around the JVM and profiling.</p>

          <p>C Scott Andreas (cscotta) and the <a
            href="http://boundary.com">Boundary</a> crew gave many helpful
          suggestions around the JVM, Maven, high_scale_lib, and profiling. Our
          conversations yielded many references, algorithms and ideas.</p>

          <p>Allen Rohner (arohner) on #clojure offered a logging configuration
          snippet.</p>

          <p>Ryan Grove and Sean Cribbs gave feedback on documentation and
          design.</p>

          <p>Reid Draper contributed a syntactic patch.</p>

          <p>Sam Newman (snewman) brought Riemann up to speed with Clojure
          1.3.</p>

          <p>Tyler Schuett offered graphic design advice.</p>
