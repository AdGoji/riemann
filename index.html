title: Riemann - A network monitoring system

<h1><span class="focus">Riemann</span> monitors distributed systems.</h1>

<div class="float-left-large">
  <p>Riemann aggregates events from your servers and applications with a
  powerful stream processing language. Send an email for every exception
  raised by your code. Track the latency distribution of your web app.
  See the top processes on any host, by memory and CPU. Combine
  statistics from every Riak node in your cluster and forward to
  Graphite. Send alerts when a key process fails to check in. Know how
  many users signed up right this second.</p>

  <p class="callout">Riemann provides <i class="focus">low-latency,
    transient shared state</i> for systems with many moving parts.</p>

    <img src="images/dash.png" alt="Dashboard shows an overview of CPU, memory, and application metrics." />
    <p>A small, extendable <a href="dashboard.html">Sinatra app</a> shows
    your system at a glance. Instantly identify hotspots, down services,
    and unbalanced loads.</p>

    <p>Riemann can tell you as much or as little as you want. Throttle or
    roll up multiple events into a single messages. Get emails about
    exceptions in your code, provider downtime, or latency spikes. You can
    also integrate with <a href="https://github.com/aphyr/riemann/blob/master/src/riemann/pagerduty.clj">PagerDuty</a>.</p>

    <h2>Powerful stream primitives</h2>

    <p>Riemann streams are just Clojure functions. You can use dozens of
    built-in streams for combining, filtering, altering, and forwarding
    events, or write your own.</p>

    <h2>Graph everything</h2>
{% highlight clj %}
(graphite {:host "graphs.pdx"})
{% endhighlight %}

    <img src="images/api-latency.png" alt="An API latency graph" />
    <p>Like <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">Statsd</a>, Riemann can forward any event stream to <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com">Graphite</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Query states</h2>
{% highlight clj %}
state = "error rate" and (not host =~ "www.%")
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>Search the Riemann index with a small query language. Clients can
    monitor each other, generate reports, or produce dashboards.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Simple clients</h2>

{% highlight ruby %}
r = Riemann::Client.new
r << {service: "www", state: "down", metric: 10000}
r['state = "down"'] 
# => [#<Riemann::Event @service="www" ... >]
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>Riemann speaks <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol
      Buffers</a> over TCP and UDP for a compact, portable, and fast wire
    protocol. See the <a
      href="https://github.com/aphyr/riemann-ruby-client/tree/master/lib/riemann">Ruby
      client</a> as a guide.</a>

    <h2>Excuse me, but how is this better than Hadoop?</h2>
    <p>I built Riemann because <a href="http://showyou.com">Showyou</a>
    has hundreds of moving parts spread over dozens of systems, and I
    needed host- and app-level monitoring that didn't suck.  I've had a
    long history with monitoring, and have some objections to existing
    tools like Nagios, Cacti, and the like. Specifically:</p>

      <p>Configuration as code.</p>

      <p>Make the client experience so friendly, people actually <i>want</i> to
      instrument their code.</p>

      <p>Push instead of polling. Lower latency, simpler code, less
      firewall complexity.</p>

      <p>Integrate with other systems. Re-use existing libraries and
      monitoring tools.</p>

      <p>Flexibility. Ops is all about adapting someone else's code to
      your own complex system. Create many small, composable pieces.</p>

      <p>Faster. This all depends on what kind of streams you use, but
      our (pretty complex) installation at Showyou will handle 11,000
      <i>synchronous</i> events/sec, and I haven't even started
      optimizing. My goal is somewhere around 100K/s. This is nothing in
      Real Programmer terms, but it should be sufficient.</p>
